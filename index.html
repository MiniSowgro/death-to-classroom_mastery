      What is Classroom Mastery?
      </h3>
      
      <p id="bgp">
      Classroom Mastery, as described by their website, is a service that schools hire in order to form, quote: "
Create calm and ordered classrooms where learning takes priority." <br>
This cannot be further from the truth. <br> While in theory, creating a calm learning environment is great, the techniques employed make school feel less like a fun place to learn and more like a prison, where the slightest slip-up could result in punishment.<br>

    <h3 id="5title">5: The Cue to Start</h3>
    <p id="5p">Everyone who's experienced the Cue to Start knows it. The teacher stands at the front of the class, does the classic countdown, and makes the entire class participate. While a good idea to corral the students in theory, strategies like this only work <b>in moderation</b>.<br>Some teachers spam the cue to start, using it more than actual words, the current leader using it 18 times in one lesson. 55 divided by 18 is 3.05, meaning they used the cue to start once every 3 minutes. Most students even completely disregard it, and I ask you this: <br> if students are disregarding the strategy specifically put in place to control them, is it working?  </p>

    4: Inconsistency
    </h3>
    <p id="4p">
    As with all endeavours, teachers all put their own personal spin on things. Their methods will be a little different, the way they lead their classes will change, but you'll get used to all of them. It adds some flair to each and every class you attend. This directly clashes with Classroom Mastery, as their mission directive is to standardize classes - but some teachers completely ignore this, leaving a divide in the staff, those who follow the Classroom Mastery teachings as law (going as far as to carry the book around) and those who don't really care. How do you expect students to respect and get used to everything when the teachers they look up to all send mixed messages?

    3: The Voices
    </h3>
    <p id="3p">
    There's only a few places that you aren't supposed to talk. Libraries, funerals, and apparently, during class - at all. A trademark of Classroom Mastery is their 4 voices, that being silent, partner, group, and classroom. The idea is that you can tell your students which voice to use, and they'll use that voice. But no! Most teachers default to silent voice, leaving students dreading certain classes where they sit next to their friends and cannot talk to them, likening a usually lively class into a veritable prison.

    2: The Pop Sticks
    </h3>
    <p id="2p">
    We all know the feeling of being called for a question despite not putting your hand up. While not fun, it's at least temporary, and the people who <b>do</b> put their hand up get called. Enter - Popsicle Sticks. Omnipresent, these are here to ensure that the people who do know the answer don't get picked, and the people who don't? They just get embarrassed in front of a room full of their peers. The feeling of dread that ensues when the teacher starts jumbling those god-forsaken sticks is among the most anxious I've ever felt at school.
