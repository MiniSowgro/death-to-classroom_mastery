      What is Classroom Mastery?
      </h3>
      
      <p id="5p">
      Classroom Mastery, as described by their website, is a service that schools hire in order to form, quote: "
Create calm and ordered classrooms where learning takes priority." <br>
This cannot be further from the truth. <br> While in theory, creating a calm learning environment is great, the techniques employed make school feel less like a fun place to learn and more like a prison, where the slightest slip-up could result in punishment.<br> Also, look at this guy. Does he look like he knows how kids learn?
